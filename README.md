### KMeans Clustering Classifier
This code shows the implementation of KMeans classifier to apply unsupervised learning. The goal of this task is to predict the optimum number of clusters from the iris dataset then visualize it. I used the elbow method which plots the number of clusters versus Within cluster sum of square (wcss) where the best number of clusters is at the point where the wcss does not significantly decrease anymore.
